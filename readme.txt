Make direct image links open in prettyphoto

== Description ==
prettyPhoto is a great jQuery lightbox clone that i often use in projects. Again, a plugin to make it easier. :-)
This plugins search to every image that is inside a link and adds prettyPhoto parameters to the link.

Works for Gallery and single images, make sure to choose for media file instead of media attachment when you place an image.
